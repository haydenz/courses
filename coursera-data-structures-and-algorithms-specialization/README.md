# Data Structures and Algorithms
**[Certificate Obtained](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/766EHS2SD3FM)**


**About this [Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)**: this specialization is a mix of theory and practice
  - Learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems
  - Implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems 
  - Multiple tests to check each coding problem's correctness and running time 
  - Two real-world projects: 
    1. Big Networks

        Analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!)
    2. Genome Assembly

        Assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.
